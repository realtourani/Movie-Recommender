# Movie-Recommender
The Movie-Recommender project is designed to provide personalized movie recommendations based on user preferences. To begin, users are prompted to vote for the movies they have already seen from the dataset, ensuring that selected movies exist within the provided dataset (located in section 7 of the `ipynb` file). After casting their votes, users can execute the code to receive recommendations tailored to their preferences. These recommendations are generated by the system, taking into account the user's voting history and movie ratings.
